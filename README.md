##  Problem Statement — The Hidden Cost of Career Decisions:

Every year, students accept internships and job offers based on CTC numbers, brand names, or peer pressure — without reliable insight into what those roles actually involve in day-to-day reality.

Most existing platforms focus on:
- Job listings
- HR-approved role descriptions
- Surface-level salary numbers

They fail to answer what students actually care about:
- What will my real in-hand salary be?
- Will I be overworked or burned out?
- Is the internship meaningful work or just busywork?
- What downsides aren't mentioned during hiring?
- Which offer truly fits my priorities — learning, money, or balance?

As a result, students often:
- Accept mismatched offers
- Experience early burnout
- Regret decisions within months
- Make choices based on incomplete or misleading information

There is no unified system that helps students compare opportunities using **reality, risk, and long-term impact**.
